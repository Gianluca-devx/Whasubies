I swapped my usual breakfast for something fresh and colorful, and I already feel a little more energized. It’s just the first step, but I’m excited to see how these small changes add up over time. Here’s to a healthier me—one meal at a time!"),
        Diary(date: "24/10/2025", diaryText: "I felt sad all day, and somehow my mind went straight to chocolate. It’s funny how emotions can guide cravings—sweetness feels like comfort when everything else feels heavy. After finishing the last piece, I realized it wasn’t really the chocolate I wanted, but a little warmth and care. Maybe next time I’ll try to feed my mood with something that truly helps me feel better inside."),
